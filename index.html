      <h2>WILD LIFE</h2>
      <p>Saving Earth’s wilderness has the power to halt climate change, end mass extinction, and decrease the frequency of pandemics. The science is clear. To stop and reverse climate change, we must protect and restore wilderness. To save Earth’s biodiversity, comprising millions of life forms, from mass extinction, we must protect and restore wilderness. To decrease the frequency of novel viruses, we must protect and restore wilderness

        Forests are made up of a large number of trees grouped together in one location. It helps in the maintenance of oxygen levels since they are a rich source of oxygen that absorbs carbon dioxide exhaled by everyone and helps to sustain the environment. Forests aid in the preservation of a pure and clean environment, which we all desire. Forests also aid in the maintenance of the ecology and biodiversity, as well as the evaporation and condensation processes. Forests are important to both humans and animals for a variety of reasons. Humans depend on forests for medicines, food, wood, and other necessities, and all wild creatures rely on them for survival and habitat. With today’s expanding human demands, we have been cutting down a lot of trees, which has resulted in the environment becoming depleted. Deforestation has resulted in numerous environmental hazards, including global warming, pollution, ozone layer depletion, and so on. It is critical to recognise the value of forests in our lives and to fight to ensure their protection. Depending on the various climatic conditions, the forests exist in various forms like deciduous forests, tropical evergreen forests, etc., but they all play a major role in maintaining the ecosystem. With the increasing demands and needs of human beings, the forests are being cut down hence leading to various hazards to the environment. Deforestation has led to a major threat called global warming. Now it is high time for humans to stop cutting down trees and depleting the habitats of animals.

        Nature refers to the natural resources and natural surroundings. The life species in nature are interrelated and create balance in nature. They form a natural food chain through which energy is passed to all the species. The series of organisms in which each organism feeds on the one below it in the sequence is called the food chain in natural ecosystem. Food chain includes several plants, organisms, animals and other living species. This natural food chain is the source of energy for the forest species. The energy is passed from one creature to the other which helps them grow and survive.

For example in forest deer feeds on the grass and green plants and the tiger feeds on the deer. Plants get their energy form sunlight and nutrients from soil. Deer is herbivores animal. Herbivores animals depend on plants for energy and are vegetarians. Tiger is carnivorous animal. Carnivorous animals eat herbivores and sometimes other carnivorous for energy. So there is a whole chain that includes plants, herbivores, carnivorous and plants consume energy from sunlight. And there are lots of animals that eat plants and meat both. These are called omnivorous animals. For instance, black beer is an omnivorous animal. Some omnivorous also eat dead animals and those are called scavengers. Thus, the chain goes on.

All the species on earth are important for the survival of entire series of organisms and to balance the natural cycle.
